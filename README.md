# ArrayExercises
Build arrays and insert data from plain english specifications.

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this project.
2. Work inside of the `build_arrays.js` file. Inside that file you will see your objectives as comments.
3. use `nodemon` to help your work flow. e.g. `nodemon build_arrays.js`

Once you are done, commit and push your work.  
Then checkout the branch of the next level.  

`git checkout level_2`

_notice your `build_arrays.js` file no longer has your original arrays from `master` branch_  
merge your changes from `master`  

`git merge master`  
_a commit message may appear, save and quit the commit message editor_  

review your `build_arrays.js` file again, did your changes merge in properly?  
if it did, continue the assignment by following the comments.  
once you are done, commit and push this branch.  
then, continue on to the next level  

`git checkout level_3` and so on.
